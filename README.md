# NBABot Resources Repository
This Repository holds information that is crucial to NBABot's future restructure. We're working on cataloguing data for everyone. This might be helpful I guess. Not all Data was taken from the NBA API, as some things listed in folders such as `TeamData` & `LeagueHistoryData` are just stuff I've copied. These will function with the Discord Bot. Hopefully. All endpoint documentation has been mapped in [Swar's API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api)
