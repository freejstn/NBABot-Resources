**NBABot Data**

This repository holds historical and current team data from the NBA. It is used in NBABot's development as a resource to provide better data. Included currently is:
- Team Data (Logos, Arenas, Colors, Locations) from every NBA Champion and current NBA Team.
- League History, including Champions and MVPs.

*There is more on the way, though.*
